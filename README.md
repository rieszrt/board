The hotel and airbnb industry has been hit hard by the recent recession. Credit card companies are seeing a decrease in the number of transactions being processed in this industry. This is due to a decrease in travel and tourism overall as unemployment rates have increased and people are cutting back on their spending.

We analysed transaction volume and amounts processed by Visa for Luxury, medium and economy class accomodations and found that 
-Luxury class transactions have decreased by 26.3%
-Medium class transactions have decreased by 17.3%
-Economy class transactions have decreased by 13.6%

The reason for the decrease in volume is evident when we compare these numbers to average room prices.
-Luxury class room prices have decreased by 12.1%
-Medium class room prices have decreased by 3.2%
-Economy class room prices have increased by 2.1%

when we look at transactions for airbnb, it paints a similar story:

-The number of transactions processed by airbnb has decreased by 21.6%

-The average transaction amount has decreased by 12.5%

-The average nightly rate for an airbnb listing has decreased by 7.8%

These numbers show that the recent recession has had a negative impact on the hotel and airbnb industry. Credit card companies are seeing a decrease in the number of transactions being processed in this industry. People are choosing cheaper accommodation options and are spending less overall on travel and tourism. We can expect to see these trends continue in the coming months as the recession continues to impact the economy.
