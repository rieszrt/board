Airbnb is an online marketplace that connects people who need a place to stay with people who need to rent out extra space. Airbnb allows people to search for a list of rental properties from around the world. Airbnb was founded in 2008 and is headquartered in San Francisco, California.

Airbnb has been a controversial company since its inception. Some people argue that Airbnb is taking away business from hotels and other traditional forms of lodging. Others argue that Airbnb is providing a much needed service for people who cannot afford traditional lodging.

Airbnb has been banned in some cities, such as New York City and Santa Monica, California. Airbnb has also been criticized for not doing enough to vet its hosts and guests, which has led to some safety concerns. 
However, Airbnb has taken steps to address these concerns, such as introducing a verification process for hosts and guests.

Despite the controversy, Airbnb is one of the most successful startups in recent history. Airbnb is currently valued at $31 billion and is used by millions of people around the world.
